# Financial Modelling & Analysis - Option Pricing Prediction streamlit App!

This repository contains a Python application called `streamtest.py` that utilizes the Streamlit framework to predict and evaluate NSE stock exchange option prices using Black Scholes Model. The application supports both put and call options and takes various input parameters into consideration.

## About the Application

The `streamtest.py` application is designed to provide users with a convenient way to analyze and forecast option prices on the NSE stock exchange. By inputting relevant parameters, users can obtain predictions for both put and call options, enabling them to make informed investment decisions.


## Under Development

This project is currently under development. I am planning to expand this repo to make a streamlit app that aids in making a customaizable equity portfolio for the user! Stay tuned for updates!
